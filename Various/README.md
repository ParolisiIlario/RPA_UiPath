# Easter Day Calculation


The same instructions are contained within the code but in Italian.

  
This Sequence Calculates Easter Day. Accept one or both of the following arguments as input:

 -   **in_date** = DateTime format of which you want to know the Easter day for the same year
 
 -  **in_intAnno** = The year of which you want to know the Easter day in int32 format.

They are returned on exit: 

 - **out_EasterDay** = a date in DateTime format of Easter day.


 - **out_isSuccess** = Boolean which assumes the value True if the calculation has occurred

N.B: If both arguments are given, the Int has higher priority over the date
